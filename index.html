                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Island-Resort.git"> <h3>Karate Island</h3> </a></li>
                    <p> Karate Island uses html and incorperates css for styling</p>
                      <p> The inspiration for this page came from one of my favorite spongbob episodes from my childhood, and is a "real life" spoof an episode where Spongebob goes to a mystical island to learn karate only to find its an eleborate pryimad scheme selling timeshares</p>
                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Vacation-Website.git"> <h3>Hawaii Vacation</h3> </a></li>
                    <p> Vacation Website uses html, incorpates some custom css and uses bootstrap features</p>
                      <p> This is my favorite webpage in my portfolo. After learning about bootstrap in the lesson my partner and I started playing around with different features and interactive elements. I think it came out really well. For the first time I felt like the skills I was learning came together to make a great product</p>
                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Fish.git"> <h3> Fish</h3> </a></li>
                    <p> Fish uses html, and basic elements of css</p>
                      <p> I created Fish when pretty much every element of coding was a massive struggle. However I still value this page because its a tangible reminder of how far I've come in such a short time.</p>
