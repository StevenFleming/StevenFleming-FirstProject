                    <p> Karate Island uses html and incorperates css for styling</p>
                      <p> The inspiration for this page came from one of my favorite spongbob episodes from my childhood, and is a "real life" spoof an episode where Spongebob goes to a mystical island to learn karate only to find its an eleborate pryimad scheme selling timeshares</p>
                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Vacation-Website.git"> <h3>Hawaii Vacation</h3> </a></li>
                    <p> Vacation Website uses html, incorpates some custom css and uses bootstrap features</p>
                      <p> This is my favorite webpage in my portfolo. After learning about bootstrap in the lesson my partner and I started playing around with different features and interactive elements. I think it came out really well. For the first time I felt like the skills I was learning came together to make a great product</p>
                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Fish.git"> <h3> Fish</h3> </a></li>
                    <p> Fish uses html, and basic elements of css</p>
                      <p> I created Fish when pretty much every element of coding was a massive struggle. However I still value this page because its a tangible reminder of how far I've come in such a short time.</p>

          <h1> About Myself </h1> 
          <p>I was born in Pasadena to my loving Parents Mark and Dara Fleming. My mother shared with me her love of cooking and the arts of cooking and being open and generous to others. My dad shared with me his love of athletics and humility it takes to provide for those your love.</p>
          <p> I played every sport under the sun growing up and fell in love with writing. For college I attended UC Santa Barbra where I studied Religious Studies and focused my research on State Formation in Iran and Tibetan Buddhism. Later in college I gravitated athletically towards rock climbing and have found so many wonderful people and experiences through climbing.</p>
          <p>Upon graduation wanted to help frontline-communities affected by wildfires in my home state of California. I was hired on as an Environmental Scientist for Jesco on the Campfire Cleanup Project. As an Environmental Unit Leader, I worked in the field testing for contaminants in the ruins of residents homes and testing the soil after those structures had been cleared.</p>
          <p>I am extremely grateful to have been a part this project.  While participating in the cleanup project I also saw the need and potential for programming in the field of Environmental Science. I decided to learn programming  in the hopes to help develop technology to help the human community</p>

                      <p>I saw Shane Grammer's work every day in Paradise. His incredible art was a constant and potent reminder of the deep human element omnipresent within my work as a scientist </p>
                      <p> As I spent thousands of hours executing protocal and metholdogies so "Hot Zones" could become Homes again, listening to community members stories allowed me a deeper connection to the purpose of my work. These murals became a static visual representation of those stories, one that wasn't created by disaster but by humans.</p> 
                      <p> I hope translate the professional and personal skills I gathered as a scientist while working in the Campfire project into my carrer as a Developer</p>
